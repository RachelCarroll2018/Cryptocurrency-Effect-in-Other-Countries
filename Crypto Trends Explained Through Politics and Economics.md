# Crypto Trends Explained Through Politics and Economics

​	Throughout the previous few years, cryptocurrency has become the hottest topic in today's financial climate. The demand for the decentralized asset has been steadily on the rise as consumers lose trust in more traditional institutions such as central banks. Unlike traditional currency, cryptocurrencies are not issued or backed by any governmental body. This means that it is impossible for a country to tax or confiscate the assets. Additionally, due to their limited supply, there is no inflation or deflation as seen with fiat currency. Thanks to blockchain technology, many nations with unstable currencies and political turmoil such as Venezuela have seen a massive surge in demand for cryptocurrency. 

​	The above bar chart shows the top 5 nations with cryptocurrency ownership based on percentage population. These are all developing nations with the exception of Singapore. In order to explain this trend, one must first understand each country's socioeconomic climate.

**Ukraine**

​	The country of Ukraine has seen a tremendous amount of political unrest due to high tensions with Russia. On February 24th, 2022 Vladimir Putin began his invasion on Ukraine, sending the country's economy on a downward spiral. Due to rising tensions since November 2021, Ukraine's currency, the Hryvnia, has depreciated against the dollar by nearly 12%. A major surge in cryptocurrency has been seen heavily in part with donations for various war-related causes such as Aid for Ukraine. Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance have donated more than $10 million dollars in digital assets as a part of its Ukrainian Emergency Relief Fund. Many major players in the cryptocurrency world, such as the founder of TRON, Justin Sun, have also taken the initiative to aid Ukraine. Currently more than $100 million worth of cryptocurrency has been sent to Ukraine. The transfer of cryptocurrency is not only much faster and more secure, but also avoids many traditional fees charged by various international financial networks. In addition to these war efforts, Ukraine was extremely accepting of cryptocurrency and an early adopter, legalizing it in 2021 and ranking fourth on Chainanalysis’ 2021 Global Crypto Index, a data platform which specializes research and investigation. Their criteria takes into account on-chain cryptocurrency received which looks at total activity, on-chain retail value which looks at individual retail transactions, and peer-to-peer exchange trade volume which looks at private exchanges between two parties. All of these are weighted by purchasing power parity per capita which is the measure of a country's wealth per resident. This allows for the data to better reflect the true state of the market despite global income disparity. 

**Russia**

​	The surge in cryptocurrency usage in Russia has also been in part thanks to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In order to combat the Russian aggression, the United States has placed sanctions on many key Russian financial institutions. These sanctions prevent Russia's central bank from using its international reserves. More so, the United States and their European allies have began the removal of major Russian banks from SWIFT, an internal messaging system between more than 10,000 banks globally. These actions have effected major banks in Russia that hold nearly 80% of the country's total assets. Within just 2 weeks of the invasion, the value of the Ruble depreciated by 46% against the dollar. The currency slowly recovered within a month and a half thanks to strict limits set by Russia's central bank on currency exchange and transfers overseas in addition to the world's reliance on Russia's oil. Due to so much financial uncertainty and fear of having their assets frozen, many Russian citizens have begun investing into cryptocurrency as a more secure option. In fact, the country averaged $9 million worth of Bitcoin purchased daily during March. Similar to Ukraine, Russia began embracing cryptocurrency early on as well. The country is the world's third-largest Bitcoin miner and saw a record high of $150 million worth of Bitcoin purchased within a day back in May of 2021.

**Venezuela**

​	The political crisis in Venezuela has lead to the largest rate of inflation seen in Latin America. President Nicolás Maduro and the country's National Assembly continued disagreements resulted in the country's socioeconomic collapse. With large rates of inflation already preceding the 2018 election, the country's currency was headed towards a downward spiral. The election was wildly regarded as rigged, and with the two political leaders both claiming sovereignty, the country's currency skyrocketed into hyperinflation. Many countries such as the United States recognize Juan Guaidó as the rightful president, causing the country to see massive sanctions on their oil industry and ability to trade foreign currency.

​	As seen in the above graph, the currency became basically worthless. From November 2018-April 2019 the country saw monthly inflation of over 100%. This means that local Venezuelans saw their life savings plummet. Many in the country turned to cryptocurrency in order to regain purchasing power. Due to power being subsidized by the Venezuelan government, many have also turned to Bitcoin mining as an effective way of generating income. Venezuela ranks 7th in the Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index of 2021 due to their high volume of peer-to-peer trading. Finally, play-to-earn games are extremely popular in Venezuela as they provide a much more efficient way of generating income than the extremely low wages throughout the nation. The country's currency however; has begun stabilizing in late 2021 averaging to 4.5 Bolivar per U.S. Dollar in part thanks to their oil reserves and international prices spiking.

**Singapore**

​	Singapore has been at the forefront of the digital space and is recognized as the Asian Hub for cryptocurrency. Thanks to strong regulation and tax infrastructure changes done by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore is regarded as one of the most cryptocurrency friendly nations. The Payment Services Act of 2019, which made it illegal for a crypto firm to operate without a license was the first step taken by the MAS. The head of MAS, Ravi Menon, explains that he wants Singapore to have a head start in the space, so that the country can better understand the risks and benefits. Due to these high ambitions, cryptocurrency exchanges have attempted to get licensed in the country in order to capitalize on the growing market; however, Singapore is being extremely selective with their decisions. Knowing that the digital assets are being properly regulated, cryptocurrency demand in Singapore has risen tremendously. In fact, Singapore's largest bank, DBS (Development Bank of Singapore), is 1 of 3 cryptocurrency exchanges active in the country, bringing the digital assets to tons of retail investors.

**Kenya**

​	Finally, Kenya is leading the digital space in Africa. With the highest rate of peer to peer transactions globally, Chainanalysis has ranked Kenya one of the top cryptocurrency friendly nations in the world. Like many developing African nations, the pandemic has set off a chain reaction of depreciation. In fact, since April 2021 alone the Kenyan Shilling has depreciated by more than 7% against the dollar. The currency is currently at its lowest value to date. As the dollar continues to appreciate, Kenyan citizens have turned to cryptocurrency as a more stable store of value. Another reason for the boost in cryptocurrency demand is high remittance transaction fees charged by traditional banks, especially in Africa, which are completely avoided with cryptocurrency. According to a report by the World Bank, Sub-Saharan Africa leads the world's remittance rate at an average of 9.4%. With the removal of the rate, normal citizens can transfer more money across the boarders. Similar to Venezuela, play-to-earn games are also taking off in Africa as a means of better income. 

**Small Takeaway**

​	Overall looking at cryptocurrency ownership based on percentage population allows for a better understanding of how cryptocurrency is beneficial for developing sectors throughout the world. With decentralization, owners can expect a more secure store of value instead of constant depreciation against the dollar and massive inflation rates as seen with Venezuela. Cryptocurrency owners are able to also send money internationally at a much faster pace while avoiding major remittance fees, as seen with the donations to Ukraine and cryptocurrency adoption in Kenya. Finally, as more regulation is adopted, more demand will generate as investors will become less skeptical, as seen with Singapore.
