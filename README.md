# Cryptocurrency Adoption Across The World
### Background:

 In this financial analysis we take a deep dive into how the adoption of cryptocurrencies is challenging the traditional financial infrastructure across international lines. Wwe will be pulling publicly available data to look for patterns, trends and correlation to give our audience the most accurate macro level perspective with micro level details as to how we came to our conclusions. <br><br>
 
We intend to present the results of our analysis with the use of widely accepted and understood metrics within the financial industry along with software programming tools, such as but not limited to, data sampling, data anaylysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sharpe Ratio, etc to illustrate that cryptocurrency is improving the economic state of those outside of the traditional financial system.<br>

<br>We will collect data going back 5 years representing 5 cyptocurrecies and fiat currencies form 5 countries. We will then compare and contrast the data using the S&P 500 and the US dollar as benchmarks to gain a better understanding of future investment potential. Our primary endpoint will to answer the follwing questions and provide a clear view of trends and patterns both statistically and visually.

>How are countries affected by the increase in cryptocurrency usage outside of the United States?
>How are cryptocurrencies performing when compared to the native countries established currency?
>What cryptocurrencies are countries interacting with the most?
>How are the top cryptocurrencies performing when compared to established investments indicies such as the S&P 500?
>With all economic factors remaining constant, we will also be running a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the potential profit/loss outcome of a $ 15k (USD) investment five years out with the start year of 2022.
