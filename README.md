# Cryptocurrency Adoption Across The World
### Background:

In this financial analysis we take a deep dive into how the adoption of cryptocurrencies is challenging the traditional financial infrastructure across international lines. We will be pulling publicly available data to look for patterns, trends and correlation to give our audience the most accurate macro level perspective with micro level details as to how we came to our conclusions. <br><br>
 
We intend to present the results of our analysis with the use of widely accepted and understood metrics within the financial industry along with software programming tools, such as but not limited to, data sampling, data analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sharpe Ratio, etc.<br>

> Ukraine and Russia have the highest usage of cryptocurrency based on their percentage with Ukraine leading at 12.73% usage and Russia at 11.91% usage. 

>### With all economic factors remaining constant, we will also be running a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the potential profit/loss outcome of a $10k (USD) investment five years out with the start year of 2022.
> There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $10,000 in a portfolio of these cryptocurrencies (LTC, DASH, XMR over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $12279.83 and $1902208.45.

> There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $10,000 in a portfolio of these foreign currencies (KES, UAH, VES) over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $8026.91 and $10859.45.
