# Cryptocurrency Adoption Across The World
### Background:

In this financial analysis we take a deep dive into how the adoption of cryptocurrencies is challenging the traditional financial infrastructure across international lines. Our main questions to answer are outlined below. <br>
 
We intend to present the results of our analysis with the use of widely accepted and understood metrics within the financial industry along with software programming tools, such as but not limited to, data sampling, data analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sharpe Ratio, etc.<br>

> ### How have our five cryptocurrencies performed since 2017:

> In this first graph we wanted to look at all crypto's to see which one's had the largest increase and decrease in price over the last five years. Unsurprisingly, the results were Bitcoin and Ethereum producing over 1000% positive returns over the allotted time.

> So, we broke our graphs down to just include the smaller three stocks, Litecoin, Dash, and Monero. They all had very similar trends of a large increase in stock price in the beginning to mid 2021 with a slight decrease through 2022. Dash had an incredible increase in stock price in 2018 and almost just as quickly sharply declined. This will result likely in a very high volatility. 

>### With all economic factors remaining constant, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the potential profit/loss outcome of a $10k (USD) investment five years out with the start year of 2022.

> There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $10,000 in a portfolio of these cryptocurrencies (LTC, DASH, XMR over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $12279.83 and $1902208.45.

> ### However, the numbers provided above don't paint an accurate representation of the risk associated with cryptocurrencies and it's volatility. So, which cryptocurrencies carry the highest volatility?

> Litecoin, Dash, and Monero surprisingly have the highest volatility from the 5 year data set.

>### What countries have adopted cryptocurrency the most based on population percentage?
>

> 
> Ukraine and Russia have the highest usage of cryptocurrency based on their percentage with Ukraine leading at 12.73% usage and Russia at 11.91% usage. 

> ### Is there a correlation between S&P 500 and Cryptocurrency?

> ![sp500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98990090/170398845-a507dea7-462e-4bac-aa17-f95562022289.png)
> 
> Interestingly, almost all crypto's are negatively correlated to the S&P 500. When the stock price of S&P 500 increases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and Ethereum very strongly decrease. Cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Monero are also negatively correlated but not as strongly. Finally, Dash is not strongly correlated at all, the S&P 500 has no effect on stock prices for Dash.
